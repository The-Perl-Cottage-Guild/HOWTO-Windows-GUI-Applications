# Introduction to Perl GUI Programming for the Windows Desktop

This is the main repository focusing exclusively on creating and distributing
Perl GUI programs on Windows. Yes, Perl programmers and Windows make strange
bedfellows, but Windows customers don't mind paying a _Microsoft Tax_ for programs
that meet their needs. And better than that, they don't usually care what it is
written in.

# Statement of Information Goals

This repository will have reached it's stated goal when it contains at least one
fully described and verifiably effective workflow that allows a diligent Perl programmer
to develop, package, and distribute a Windows GUI application in a way that makes
the process indistinguishable from any other program they might purchase, download,
and install on their local Windows machine.

There will likely be scripts and tools in this repository, but primarily this is an
information resource. Tools may be placed in additional repositories.

# Areas of Concern

Our aim is to provide a well researched, documented, and reliable means of doing the
following towards to goal of producing _Yet Another Windows GUI_ that is indistinguisable
from something produced from other native Windows development workflows.

This includes all the following, a ...

1. development environment (which doesn't have to be _on_ Windows itself)
2. testing environment (again, not necessarily _on_ Windows)
3. process to package the _Windows GUI application_ into a standalone `.exe`, or
4. process to provide a _typical_ Windows installation experience

# Resources Available

Currently, means of distributing information and providing community interaction will be facilitated via:

1. this repository (PRs needed!!)
2. the repo's WIKI (more stable documentation)
3. the repo's _Discussion_ forum (for questions, members helping members, etc)

# Conclusion

Thank you, and enjoy helping Perl take over the Windows desktop!
